**Dead projects:**
- https://github.com/nixin72/staple - Doom Emacs does this already
- https://github.com/nixin72/seer - Discovered ripgrep which is so fast this isn't necessary
- https://github.com/nixin72/project-icarus - Discovered Clojure, which is everything I wanted and more
- https://github.com/nixin72/pattern-match.js - Better alternatives (also I want out of JS)
